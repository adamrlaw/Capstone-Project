    "\n",
    "Because they are highly regulated, home appraisal professionals go through a rigirious training, continuning education and lengthy on-the-job experience before they become licensed apprasiers. This is a must, as home appraisals are routinely relied on for mortgage financing by financial instutions.\n",
